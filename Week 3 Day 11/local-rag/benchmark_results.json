      "response": "Here's a well-structured and documented Python function that splits a given string into overlapping chunks of a specified size, with a defined overlap between consecutive chunks. The function ensures that each chunk has a specified number of overlapping characters with the previous one, and handles edge cases like when the remaining text is shorter than the chunk size.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Function Purpose**\nThe `chunk_text` function takes a string and splits it into overlapping segments. Each segment (chunk) overlaps with the previous one by a specified number of characters. This is useful in applications like text analysis, sliding window algorithms, etc.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Parameters**\n- `text`: The input string to be split.\n- `chunk_size`: The size of each chunk.\n- `overlap`: The number of characters by which each chunk overlaps with the previous one.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd01 **Example Usage**\n```python\nresult = chunk_text(\"abcdefgh\", 3, 1)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n['abc', 'bcd', 'def', 'gh']\n```\n\nEach chunk overlaps the previous one by one character (e.g., `'abc'` overlaps with `'bcd'` by `'bc'`), and the last chunk is `'gh'` which is shorter than the chunk size.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 **How It Works**\n- The function initializes an empty list to store the chunks.\n- It starts at the beginning of the string (`start = 0`) and creates a chunk by slicing from `start` to `start + chunk_size`.\n- The `start` is then incremented by `(chunk_size - overlap)` to ensure the next chunk overlaps with the current one.\n- The process continues until the entire string is processed.\n\n\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05dd:\n\n```python\ndef chunk_text(text, chunk_size, overlap):\n    \"\"\"\n    Splits the input text into overlapping chunks of specified size.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    text (str): The input string to be split.\n    chunk_size (int): The size of each chunk.\n    overlap (int): The number of characters by which each chunk overlaps with the previous one.\n    \n    Returns:\n    list: A list of overlapping chunks.\n    \n    Example:\n    >>> chunk_text(\"abcdefgh\", 3, 1)\n    ['abc', 'bcd', 'def', 'gh']\n    \"\"\"\n    chunks = []\n    start = 0\n    while start < len(text):\n        chunk = text[start:start + chunk_size]\n        chunks.append(chunk)\n        start += (chunk_size - overlap)\n    return chunks\n```\n\n---\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f **Important Notes**\n- The function assumes `chunk_size > overlap` to avoid an infinite loop or invalid chunk sizes.\n- If `chunk_size == overlap`, the function will only return a single chunk (since all characters are considered overlapping).\n- The function gracefully handles the case where the remaining text is shorter than the chunk size by returning the last partial chunk.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udce6 **Use Case Example**\nA simple use case is analyzing text with a sliding window for pattern recognition, NLP, or data processing where overlapping segments are needed.\n\n```python\n# Analyze text with 3-character chunks and 1-character overlap\nresult = chunk_text(\"abcdefgh\", 3, 1)\nfor chunk in result:\n    print(chunk)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nabc\nbcd\ndef\ngh\n```\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Summary\nThis function provides a clean and efficient way to split a string into overlapping chunks, with control over how much each chunk overlaps with the previous one. It's versatile and can be adapted for various applications where overlapping segments are required.",
